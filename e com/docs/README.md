Edit text content directly in the `LandingPage.jsx` component:
- Hero section headlines and descriptions
- Feature titles and descriptions
- Pricing tiers and features
- Footer links and sections

### Styling
Tailwind CSS classes are used throughout. Common customizations:
- Spacing: `py-24`, `px-4`, `gap-8`
- Typography: `text-5xl`, `font-bold`, `leading-relaxed`
- Borders & Shadows: `rounded-2xl`, `border-2`, `shadow-xl`
- Hover states: `hover:bg-gray-800`, `hover:scale-105`

## Design Principles

- **Whitespace** - Generous spacing for breathing room
- **Typography** - Clear hierarchy with varying font sizes and weights
- **Transitions** - Smooth hover effects and interactions
- **Consistency** - Repeated patterns and styles throughout
